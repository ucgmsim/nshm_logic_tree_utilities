This package has utilities for working with the logic tree used in New Zealand's National Seismic Hazard Model 
(NSHM) 2022. With this package, you can create modified logic trees, use them to calculate new hazard curves, and
plot the results. For installation and usage instructions, 
please refer to the accompanying [wiki](https://github.com/ucgmsim/nshm_logic_tree_utilities/wiki).
